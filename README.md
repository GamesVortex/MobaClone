To remove the errors get the barebones master server framework from https://github.com/alvyxaz/barebones-masterserver.

-- Directories --
Chat - Simple implementation of a chat including a player changing their name.

MOBA - The implementation of the MOBA. The plan is to allow the player to select different parts of the tank. This will create variety based on different combinations.
1. Turret - powers 1 and 2
2. Ancillary Systems - power 3 and 4
3. Body/Armor - How tough the tank is. Some bodies may have weaker armour for increased energy.
Each of the different options will affect speed and may give different boosts.

Server - directory where I'm experimenting with barebones. Creating a lobby like most MOBAs.
